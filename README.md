## üß™ ADX for IoT Analytics (Hands-On Lab)
Azure Data Explorer can provide valuable insights into your IoT workloads. In the following lab, we look at thermostat IoT Devices that are in 3 different office buildings.

## Prerequisites
- An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) with an active subscription. If you don't have access to an Azure subscription, you may be able to start with a [free account](https://azure.com/free).
- You must have the necessary privileges within your Azure subscription to create resources, perform role assignments, register resource providers (if required), etc.

## ‚≠ê Instructions for Lab Deployment 

Open [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) and run the following commands:
1. Login to Azure
    ```bash
    az login
    ```

2. If you have more than one subscription, select the appropriate one:
    ```bash
    az account set --subscription "<your-subscription>"
    ```

3. Get the latest version of the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/ADXIoTAnalytics.git
    ```

4. Deploy solution
    ```bash
    cd ADXIoTAnalytics
    . ./deploy.sh
    ```

5. After deploy script completes:
    - Go to **Home** > **[Azure Data Explorer Clusters](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Kusto%2Fclusters)** > click on the newly deployed **ADX cluster** > copy the **URI** and open it in a new tab. 
    
      ![uri](assets/uri.png "uri")
    
    - Alternatively, **[ADX Web-UI](https://aka.ms/adx.try)** > click **Add Cluster** > enter your **Connection URI** > click **Add**.
    
      ![add](assets/add.png "add")
      ![added](assets/added.png "added")
     
7. Expand Database > select **IoTAnalytics** to set the Scope of the new script

## ü§î What will be deployed?
1. **IoT Central** Store Analytics Template 
  - 36 thermostat devices being created and simulated
  - Setup Export to Event Hub of telemetry data
2. **Event Hub**
  - Data exported from IoT Central
  - ADX Data Connection to ingest data
3. **Azure Digital Twins**
  - Office, Floors, and Thermostat twins
  - **Atlanta**, **Dallas**, **Seattle** offices with 6 Floors in each
  - 36 Thermostat twins created spread across the 3 offices with 2 on each floor
4. **Azure Data Explorer**
  - **StageIoTRaw** table where data lands from Event Hub to get new data
  - **Thermastats** table with update policy to transform raw data
  - Historical data from January 2022 loaded into **Thermostats** table
  - Two functions
    - **GetDevicesbyOffice**: query ADT by Office names to get all DeviceIds at the office
    - GetDevicesbyOfficeFloor: query ADT by Office and Floor to get all Devices on that floor 
5. **Storate Account**
  - **adxscript** Container to upload files configDB.KQL and Thermostat_January2022.csv
6. **Event Grid System Topic**
  - **BlobCreate** for HistoricalData when Thermostat_January2022.csv is uploaded to automatically ingest to ADX database table Thermostats.
